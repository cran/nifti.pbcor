Description: Estimate the correlation between two NIfTI images across random parcellations of the images (Fortea et al., under review). This approach overcomes the problems of both voxel-based correlations (neighbor voxels may be spatially dependent) and atlas-based correlations (the correlation may depend on the atlas used).
